# SEI27-ProjectOne
Project One Deliverable
I am an SEI student with General Assembly in Seattle. I am very new to this world of coding, but I enjoy putting puzzles together, and there is nothing more exhilirating than when a puzzle begins to take shape. So for this project One, I am implementing a word scrambler game. The process will challenge me significantly, based on the loops, array structures, and word sources I would like to fetch in order to distinguish between valid and invalid word choices that the player inputs. Here are the original markups I would like to implement. Throughout the week, I'll update the results of each day's work. - Day 1

I wrestled with myself through most of the day wondering whether my original structure could work through the parameters of the five main word validation processes: 1) word length 2) does the player input match the randomized letters the game given?
3) check the dictionary file to see if that word exists 4) How many words are left over for the player to guess 5) if the player clicks hint, give one randomized character hint for the longest word left over. What I have accomplished so far:
1) When the player submits their word choice, my program measures the input by length. Based on the length, that input goes to the specified area in the game. 2) Then, using Array.includes(), the player's inputs are matched to the lettersArray. If the player selects the incorrect letter in any order, it returns false, therefore no match is found and is added to the invalid inputs list. 3) Next, checkDictionary is an object. Using Object.entries, I composed a for... in loop that so far only console.logs the dictionary file.  -Day 2

More wrestling for day 3. The problem was I was over-complicating the process. Instead of first checking if the word is a match to the dictionary file, I was introducing at least three criteria points even before checking to see if it is a word. I chose to flip that around. For efficiency sake, why do three steps when one verifies the input and removes the outliers, too.
The includes method worked very well as I converted the word-dictionary file from an object to an array structure. My main condition is simple now: is there a match at all in the file, if not, it is invalid. If so, valid.  Then we check the input value for length. The switch statement still controls that. -Day 3
